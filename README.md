## Description

### Version 1
Using Untappd as a model app, our app will have a Client-facing side which will allow Clients to research local tattoo Artists by genre and style, keep a list of favorites, and provide Artists' contact info to make it easy to reach out to Artists and set up an appointment.

The app will also have an Artist-facing side which will allow the Artist to pin their Instagram posts as items in their profile portfolio. Artists will be able to get basic feedback from their pinned portfolio items as a measure of popularity.

### Version .Next
Clients will be able to create a Concept, which will be a description of a design. The app will provide a ranked list of Artists based on how their specialties match to the Concept properties.

Clients will be able to contact Artists internally in the app.

Artists will be able to market directly to interested Clients
